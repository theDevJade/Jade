# Features

JadeLib has a wide variety of features, with many more to come. So far:

- `FeatureGroup`'s allowing dynamic registration of events (and coroutines) via reflection.
- A modular hint system that allows creating multiple hints, while supporting vanilla hints incredibly easy.
- Tons of utility classes `ModuleSystem`, `EnumTranslation` that are abstract and allow easy extendability of their functionality to your own code!
- A 914 system allowing easy creation of recipes (both item and player)
- Voice Redirections allowing players matching a predicate to have their voice sent to all other players matching another predicate.
- An easy access audio player and utilities to allow (during runtime) conversion of audio.
- Statistics system allowing keeping track of statistics very easily with a built-in leaderboard (MVP) class.
- Useful extensions to a wide variety of classes.

And there is more to come!
