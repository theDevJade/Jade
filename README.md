# JadeLib

## JadeLib is a versatile library for Exiled SCP:SL that has a wide variety of features and some useful bundled in assemblies.

---
### Disclaimer
***The aim of JadeLib, contrary to the beliefs of 90% of the Exiled Discord, is not to give your server a cryptominer nor crash your server nor steal code without credit.***

**My goal is to make a versatile library that makes plugin development simpler and allows easy integration with other plugins, kinda like Apple's ecosystem, but Exiled. So if you plan to make a mockery of this project, provide reasoning first.**
